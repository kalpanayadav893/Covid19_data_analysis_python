# Covid19_data_analysis_python
A Python-based data analysis project on COVID-19 using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation heatmaps, WHO region insights, and key performance indicators (CFR, recovery rate). Visualizations highlight global trends and top-affected countries.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data using Python. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in COVID-19 cases.

The analysis highlights:

Top affected countries by Confirmed, Deaths, and Recoveries

Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Recovery Rate

Correlation between Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, and Active cases

WHO Region-wise impact

Visual insights through bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Libraries

Python 3.x

Pandas â€“ Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy â€“ Numerical operations

Matplotlib â€“ Visualization

Seaborn â€“ Statistical visualization

(All generated plots are stored inside the figures folder)

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Countries such as USA, Brazil, and India dominate in confirmed cases

A strong positive correlation exists between Confirmed Cases and Deaths

Average Global Recovery Rate is around 65â€“70%

Average Global Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is around 3â€“4%

WHO regions Europe and the Americas show the highest burden
